# Internship Management System (IMS)

A web-based application designed to centralize and streamline internship listings, applications, and status tracking using structured workflows.

## Project Overview
Managing internships manually using spreadsheets and emails often leads to data inconsistency, poor visibility, and high operational effort.

This project was built to organize internship operations in a single system and improve tracking, coordination, and clarity for both students and administrators.

## Problem Statement
- Multiple internship records handled manually
- No centralized application tracking
- High effort in monitoring application statuses

## Solution
A centralized system that:
- Stores internship listings in a structured database
- Tracks student applications and their lifecycle
- Provides clear visibility into application status

## Key Features
- Internship listing and browsing
- Student application submission
- Application status tracking (Applied / Approved / Rejected)
- Structured MySQL database for internships and users
- Basic role-based workflow for admin and users
- Clean MVC-based architecture

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Java (Spring Boot)
- Frontend: JSP, HTML, CSS
- Database: MySQL
- Architecture: MVC
- Tools: Git, SQL

## System Workflow
1. Admin adds internship listings
2. Students browse available internships
3. Students apply through the system
4. Admin reviews applications
5. Application status is updated and tracked centrally

## Impact
- Reduced manual tracking effort
- Improved organization of internship data
- Clear visibility into application progress
- Structured workflow suitable for operational use cases

## Learning & Outcomes
- Translating operational requirements into system design
- Database schema design for workflow-based systems
- Backend development and data handling
- Writing clear technical documentation

## Future Enhancements
- Authentication and authorization
- Email notifications for status updates
- Advanced filtering and search
- Admin dashboards and analytics
- UI/UX improvements
